    "# Agents & Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple, often competing, and usually vague definition of what an LLM agent is. In general, however, it describes LLM-powered systems that can accomplish complex tasks by chaining multiple LLMs together and/or adding addtional tools (such as a calculator or external APIs) into the chain. The use of tools is important, as it allows LLMs to excel at tasks they are naturally bad at - for example, a model will suddenly be a lot better at math if it does not probabilistically guess the result of an equation, but can access Python to type in the numbers and calculate the result. A lot of the \"intelligence\" showcased in LLM-applications such as ChatGPT, such as turning data into graphs, comes from such agents and their use of tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple frameworks to using agents and tools, including solutions by openAI. We will, however, use [_LangChain_](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) and [_LangGraph_](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), as they are more flexible and provide compatibility for open source solutions such as Ollama. Additionally, this framework comes with a number of powerful functionalities which we will not cover in-depth here, such as [message handling](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_history/) for prolonged chat applications, forcing chat models to return [structured output](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/structured_outputs/), addding [Human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/) functionality, or pre-built [ReAct agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/prebuilt/#langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent)."

    "## Supervisors\n",
    "\n",
    "One application of agentic systems are supervisors. They are an additional LLM that \"supervise\" other models, either by delegating tasks to different parts of the system (e.g. different tools) or by judging the output of an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set up such a system, we will use _LangGraph_ to set up a graph - a network - of different models. The communication both between user input and between the models will - once again - be handled in the message format we already know. However, as we will see, using messages to communicate between models will require a slightly different use of messages. Specifically, we will need to make the models communicate by adding messages to previous messages. We will do so by utilizing a `MessagesState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other things, this allows us to leverage the strengths of different models, or have a more powerful model judge the output of a weaker model, saving compute by passing less input to the powerful model and have it judge only edge cases."

    "## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common tool uses is so-called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It allows a model to access a database, find documents that might help answer the question it is facing, and incorporate the content of these documents into its answer. This makes LLMs a lot more reliable when it comes to reporting factual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central building block of RAG systems is the so-called retriever. It is responsible for retrieving relevant documents. When working with text data, it makes use of embedding models to retrieve relevant documents. Note, however, that a retriever can also access an API, such as Wikipedia or Google, to retrieve documents! This makes them very flexible for a large number of tasks."

    "If you are interested in building your own Chroma vector store, you can use this code. Note that it assumes that your documents are stored as PDFs. If this is not the case, check out the [LangChain Page on Document Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/). Shortening the documents into smaller chunks (as done here) is optional, but it often helps retrieving more relevant information. This, however, is dependant on your documents and the task you are trying to accomplish!\n",

I recommend [Nomic](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text), as it does a pretty good job at retrieval tasks. But you can change this if needed (or curious). This means Ollama needs to run (serve) in the background when making your vector store."

Two things are important: 1) the `@tool` decorator marks the function as a tool, and b) the function description marked by `\"\"\" \"\"\"` (that would usually be part of the documentation) is visible to the model and helps it decide when and how to use the tool. Before we can use the tool in our graph, we need to turn it into a `ToolNode`."
